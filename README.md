# KindleFrame - using an Amazon Kindle to display images like a photo frame
To install, copy the contents of the "server" directory to a location that is accessible to the Kindle via http or https.
Jailbreak the Kindle and install KUAL and the screensaver hack, then copy the contents of "client" to the kindle's "extensions" directory via USB.

To enable the OnlineScreenSaver, deactivate the Screensaver Hack, run an update of the OnlineScreenSaver, turn off wifi and press the power button. Note that the device should remain plugged in to power to update the image.
It might show the "you successfully installed the screensaver hack" screen), press the power button again to come out of the screensaver, and press it once again to display the OnlineScreenSaver.

If the OnlineScreenSaver stops working, reboot the Kindle and run its update script.
